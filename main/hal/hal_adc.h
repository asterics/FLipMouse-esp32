/** @file
 * @brief HAL TASK + FUNCTIONAL TASK - This module contains the hardware abstraction as well as
 * the calculations of the ADC.
 * 
 * The hal_adc files are used to measure all ADC inputs (4 direction
 * sensors and 1 pressure sensor).
 * In addition, depending on the configuration, different ADC tasks are
 * loaded.
 * One of these tasks is loaded:<br>
 * * halAdcMouse - Use the ADC values as mouse input <br>
 * * halAdcThreshold - Use the ADC values to trigger virtual buttons 
 * (keyboard actions for example) <br>
 * * halAdcJoystick - Use the ADC input to control the HID joystick <br>
 * 
 * These tasks are HAL tasks, which means they might be reloaded/changed,
 * but they are not managed outside this module.<br>
 * In addition, the FUNCTIONAL task task_calibration can be used to
 * trigger a zero-point calibration of the mouthpiece.
 * 
 * @see adc_config_t
 * @todo Add raw value reporting for: CIM mode and serial interface
