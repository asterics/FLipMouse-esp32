/** @file 
 * @brief Event Handler - HID
 * 
 * This module is used as an event handler for all HID based
 * virtual buttons, containing:
 * * Mouse clicking, holding, pressing & release as well as movement (X/Y/Z)
 * * Keyboard press,hold,release & write
 * * Joystick press,hold,release & axis movement
 * 
 * handler_hid_init is initializing the mutex for adding a command to the
 * chained list and adding handler_hid to the system event queue.
 *
 * @note Currently, we use the system event queue (because there is already
 * a task attached). Maybe we switch to an unique one.
 * @note Mouse/keyboard/joystick control by mouthpiece is done in hal_adc!
 * @see hal_adc
