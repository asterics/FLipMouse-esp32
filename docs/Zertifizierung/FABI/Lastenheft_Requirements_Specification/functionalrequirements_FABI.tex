\chapter{Introduction}

The FABI (Flexible Assistive Button Interface) allows control of a computer’s mouse cursor and
typing desired keyboard keys by using buttons and special/individual input methods. It can be
helpful for people who cannot use standard computer input devices – enabling them to play
games, surf the internet, write emails and much more.

\section{Purpose}

The FABI Interface can be actuated via dedicated buttons, momentary switches or self-made
electrical contacts. FABI consists of a hardware device and a graphical software application for configuration of
the desired functions.


\section{Scope}

This requirements specification is used to determine functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR) for FABI device.
The document is used in conjunction with the medical product classification and the risk management document.


\section{Background}

The AsTeRICS Foundation is a non-profit organisation that promotes the development and application of Open Source Assistive Technology (AT) for people with disabilities. Currently available button interfaces either lack of flexibility in context of configuration by the user or
in usability with many different platforms. In addition most of these assistive devices are very expensive.

FABI is designed as low-cost button interface, which can be bought as finished product or built in a DIY manner.


\section{References}

% \section{Assumptions and Constraints}
% 
% \note{Provide a list of contractual or task level assumptions and/or constraints that are preconditions to preparation of the FRS.  
% Assumptions are future situations beyond the control of the project, whose outcomes influence the success of a project.}
% 
% \subsection{Assumptions}
% \note{Examples of assumptions include: availability of a technical platform, legal changes and policy decisions.}
% 
% \subsection{Constraints}
% \note{
% Constraints are boundary conditions on how the system must be designed and constructed.  Examples include: legal requirements, technical standards, strategic decisions. 
% }
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Constraints exist because of real business conditions.  For example, a delivery date is a constraint only if there are real business consequences that will happen as a result of not meeting the date.  
%  If failing to have the subject application operational by the specified date places the organization in legal default, the date is a constraint.
%  
%  \item Preferences are arbitrary.  For example, a date chosen arbitrarily is a preference.  Preferences, if included in the FRS, should be noted as such.
% \end{itemize}

\chapter{Functional Requirements}

\section{Context}

The context of this requirement specification is limited to the FABI box (highlighted in green), a hardware module, and to the 
FABI software (FABIGUI, highlighted in blue) which is used to configure the FABI box.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{context_diagram_FABI.png}
\end{center}


The external buttons are not scope of the FABI project, either they are bought off-the-shelf or they are built in a DIY manner. The PC which
is controlled by the FABI box is also not scope of this document.


\section{User Requirements}

\begin{description}
 \item[U1 - Compatibility] The FABI box should work with all major smartphone and PC platforms. This includes Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux, Apple iOS, Google Android. In addition, the IR remote part should work with most available consumer electronic devices, which can be controlled via IR remotes.
 \item[U2 - Input options] The FABI box should be able to trigger mouse, keyboard and joystick actions on the connected device.
 \item[U3 - Connections] This box should be connected either via a USB compatible interface or via a wireless Bluetooth connection.
 \item[U4 - Buttons] External buttons should be connected via a quasi-standard 3.5mm jack plug, which is used in nearly all available assistive buttons.
 \item[U5 - Configuration] The FABI box should store the configuration, which is used by the device itself with no further interaction necessary.
 \item[U6 - Configuration interface] The FABI box configuration should be configurable via two different possibilities: on the one hand, it should be compatible with previous FABI releases and their corresponding PC GUI. On the other hand, the FABI box itself should be able to provide a WiFi hotspot, which can be used to open a configuration page via a webbrowser.
 \item[U7 - Slots] The FABI box should be able to switch between different configurations, where the switching should be triggerable by the end user.
\end{description}


% \note{Provide requirements of the system, user or business, taking into account all major classes or categories of users.  
% Provide the type of security or other distinguishing characteristics of each set of users.  List the functional requirements that compose each user requirement.  
% As the functional requirements are decomposed, the highest level functional requirements are traced to the user requirements.  
% Inclusion of lower level functional requirements is not mandatory in the traceability to user requirements if the parent requirements are already traced to them.
% }
% \note{User requirement information can be in text or process flow format for each major user class that shows what inputs will initiate the system functions, system interactions, 
% and what outputs are expected to be generated by the system.  The scenarios should be comprehensive, to the extent that all user types and all major functions are covered.  
% Give each user requirement a unique number.  Typically, user requirements have a numbering system that is separate from the functional requirements.
% Requirements may be labeled with a leading U or other label indicating user requirements.}


\section{Data Flow Diagrams}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{data_flow_fabi_normal.png} 
\end{center}

During normal operation, the enduser triggers actions be pressing (and releasing) the attached buttons. The button actions
are transformed to Keyboard, Mouse or Joystick actions (e.g., press left mouse button, click with left mouse buttonm, write a text,
press/release a joystick button), determined by the current configuration. The triggered action should transfer HID commands to the PC/smartphone device. 

These HID can be transferred either via a USB compatible interface or via a Bluetooth connection.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=100mm]{data_flow_fabi_config.png} 
\end{center}

If the user, a caretaker or any other authorized person needs to adapt the FABI configuration, two possibilities can be used:
\begin{description}
 \item[FABI software] This configuration GUI is used for all FABI devices (also previous versions 1 and 2). This software needs a USB connection, which is used to transfer so called \textit{AT commands} to the FABI device, which updates its configuration. The configuration
 user needs to connect the FABI box to his/her computer (this GUI is Microsoft Windows only), open the GUI, change the parameters and save it
 to the FABI box.
 \item[Web configuration] The FABI device is able to open a WiFi hotspot, to which a configurator can connect to. This WiFi hotspot is only
 enabled by a dedicated action, avoiding any unauthorized access. This configuration possibility is available for any WiFi device which has 
 a browser for opening the config page.
\end{description}



% \section{Logical Data Model/Data Dictionary}
% 
% \note{Create the initial Logical Data Model.  Describe data requirements by providing data entities, decomposition, and definitions in a data dictionary.
% The data requirements describe the business data needed by the application system.  
% Data requirements do not describe the physical database and are not at the level of identifying field names.}

\section{Interface Requirements}

The main interface for this device is the USB compatible connection and/or the Bluetooth interface.
Due to the standardized interfaces and protocols, following documents are referenced here (this device shall implement these
referenced documents as they are an integral part of this document):

\begin{description}
 \item[Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID), v1.11] This document describes the necessary requirements for a USB HID compatible device. These specifications need to be implement within the firmware. USB low-level specifications are met by the used microcontroller.
 \item[Universal Serial Bus Class Definitions for Communications Devices, v1.2] This document specifies the interface for communicate via a virtual serial port over the USB compatible interface.
 \item[Bluetooth v4.2 core specification] This document specifies the Bluetooth interface. Implementation is provided by the selected microcontroller.
 \item[Bluetooth HID over GATT Profile, v1.0] Profile specification to tunnel HID commands over a Bluetooth connection. This profile is
 implemented by this device.
\end{description}

In addition to these standardized profiles/specifications, this device is implementing a command API, which is used to modify the configuration or control the device. The interface requirement is part of Doxygen documentation. The currently valid API is available in
this repository in \textit{$/docs/html/README\_\_AT\_\_command\_\_API\_8md.html$} (or in raw markdown: \textit{$/main/README\_AT\_command\_API.md$}).\\
\textbf{Note:} This AT command API is used for different devices. Please consult the documentation which commands are used for this device.\\

% \subsubsection{System availability}
% 
% \note{State the period during which the application must be available to users.  
% For example, "The application must be available to users Monday through Friday between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST."
% If the application must be available to users in more than one time zone, state the earliest start time and the latest stop time. Consider daylight savings time, too.
% Include use peak times.  These are times when system unavailability is least acceptable.
% System availability is the time when the application must be available for use.  Required system availability is used in determining when maintenance may be performed.}
% 
% \subsubsection{General Performance}
% 
% \note{Specific performance requirements, related to a specific functional requirement, should be listed with that functional requirement.
% Describe the requirements for the following:}
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Response time for queries and updates
%  \item Throughput
%  \item Expected rate of user activity (for example, number of transactions per hour, day, or month, or cyclical periods)
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsubsection{Capacity}
% 
% \note{List the required capacities and expected volumes of data in business terms.  
% Do not state capacities in terms of system memory requirements or disk space - if growth trends or projections are available, provide them.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Data Retention}
% 
% \note{Describe the length of time various forms of data must be retained and the requirements for its destruction.
% For example, “The system shall retain application information for 3 years”.  Different forms of data include: system documentation, audit records, database records, access records.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Error Handling}
% 
% \note{Describe system error handling.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Validation Rules}
% 
% \note{Describe system validation rules.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Conventions/Standards}
% 
% \note{Describe system conventions and standards followed.\\
% For example: Microsoft standards are followed for windows, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for data formats, etc.}
